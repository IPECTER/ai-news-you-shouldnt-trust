## üß© Deobfuscation in Minecraft: Freedom or Prelude to Fragmentation?

Mojang recently announced that it will **remove obfuscation in Minecraft: Java Edition**.
At first glance, this seems like a positive move, offering developers and the community greater freedom.
However, in the absence of an **official loader or unified system**,
this decision risks accelerating **fragmentation within the ecosystem** rather than providing genuine openness.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Single-Player vs. Server Ecosystem**

In single-player environments, no separate server implementation is required,
so most players and developers rely on mod loaders like **Fabric** or **NeoForge**.
This ecosystem is relatively simple and stable.
Porting mods between loaders is generally manageable, and the choice of loader is mostly a matter of personal preference.

The multiplayer server ecosystem, however, is entirely different.
Here, mod loading is only part of the challenge ‚Äî server architecture, performance, and API compatibility must also be managed.
**Bukkit**, **Spigot**, **Paper**, and **Purpur** all share a common origin,
but have diverged significantly due to different philosophies and optimizations.
Attempting to layer a mod loader on top of this structure is nothing short of **recreating chaos**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ The Fork Hell of Bukkit**

The Bukkit lineage has long produced countless forks under the banner of "openness."
The lineage **Spigot ‚Üí Paper ‚Üí Purpur** is well known,
but other variants such as **Yatopia**, **Fusion**, and **Leaf** also exist.
Although these projects are all based on Bukkit‚Äôs code,
**the core code has been heavily modified over time and poorly maintained.**
As a result, compatibility between projects has deteriorated,
leaving each fork with unique bugs and issues in a **fragmented ecosystem**.

In this context, suggesting that a loader like Fabric or Forge could be added to Bukkit is
technically and practically **reckless**.
Past attempts at this have consistently failed ‚Äî **Magma**, **Cardboard**, **Hotpur**.
Each promised "integration of mods and plugins," but all ultimately resulted in
**instability, conflicts, and unmaintainable systems**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Youer ‚Äî Another Unstable Integration**

The recently introduced **Youer** is another hybrid project attempting this kind of integration.
Developed by the **MohistMC team**, it aims to merge **NeoForge and Purpur**, breaking down the boundary between mods and plugins.
However, in the process, it **removed Paper‚Äôs rewrite chunk system and Starlight patches**, directly altering critical parts of the server architecture.

This approach is less a technical advancement than a **regression that sacrifices stability**.
Forcibly modifying the server‚Äôs core to maintain compatibility is extremely risky for long-term maintenance and scalability.
In principle, these hard changes should be **implemented as separate mods**.
True integration means expanding functionality **without altering the server‚Äôs fundamental structure**.

In reality, many users still expect **compatibility with Bukkit or Paper APIs**.
Youer and MohistMC attempted to meet this demand by modifying the server core.
Removing hard changes and keeping existing plugins minimally functional was a pragmatic choice,
but I do not endorse this approach.
**Sacrificing server stability and maintainability for short-term compatibility is not a fundamental solution.**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ The Side Effects of Deobfuscation**

With obfuscation removed, anyone can freely explore and modify Minecraft‚Äôs internal code.
While this provides developers with ‚Äúfreedom,‚Äù it also marks the **start of uncontrolled fragmentation**.

We can expect a surge of unstable hybrid implementations like **Fabric + Forge + NeoForge** or **Fabric + Purpur**.
These projects may present themselves as experiments,
but they ultimately produce **ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to maintain**,
as conflicting modifications accumulate.
Once again, the Minecraft community faces the delicate balance between **freedom and chaos**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion ‚Äî Mojang‚Äôs True Oversight: No Official Loader**

Mojang appears to assume that simply releasing the code constitutes openness.
True openness begins with a **unified foundation**.
Had Mojang released an **official loader (mcje-loader)** alongside deobfuscation,
mods and servers could have operated on a consistent loading framework.

Adding modules like **fabric-bridge** or **paper-bridge** on top of this foundation
would have allowed multiple projects to coexist while maintaining a **manageable ecosystem**.
Without such infrastructure, deobfuscation alone risks fostering **fragmented chaos** rather than freedom.

We have already witnessed failures like Yatopia, Magma, and Cardboard multiple times.
If those lessons are still relevant,
this change should be **the first step toward true integration**,
not a repetition of past mistakes in another guise of chaos.
